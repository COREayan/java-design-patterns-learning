# 🔗 Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Java

---

## 📚 What is the Chain of Responsibility Pattern?

The **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects (handlers) to process a request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it.  
The request is passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it (or the chain ends).

## 🏗️ When to Use

- When multiple objects can handle a request, but the exact handler is determined at runtime.
- To decouple senders of a request from its receivers.
- To implement flexible and dynamic request handling pipelines.
- When you want to add or change handlers without modifying existing code.
