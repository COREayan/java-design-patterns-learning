# 🔄 Iterator Design Pattern in Java

---

## 📚 What is the Iterator Pattern?

The **Iterator Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation (list, array, tree, etc.).  
It encapsulates the iteration logic in a separate object called the **Iterator**, promoting clean separation of concerns.

## 🏗️ When to Use

- When you want to traverse a collection without exposing its internal structure.
- When you need multiple ways to iterate over the same collection (e.g., forward, backward, skip elements).
- When you want to provide a uniform interface for traversing different types of collections.
- To simplify client code by abstracting iteration logic.

## ✅ Example Use Cases

- **Collections Framework**: Java’s `Iterator` and `ListIterator` interfaces for traversing collections.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Trees, graphs, or linked lists that need iteration without exposing node pointers.
- **Pagination**: Iterating through pages of data fetched from APIs or databases.
- **UI Components**: Traversing through child components in a UI container.
