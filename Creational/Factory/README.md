# 🏭 Factory Method Design Pattern in Java  

---

## 📚 What is the Factory Method Pattern?  

The **Factory Method Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
It allows a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses, promoting **loose coupling** and **flexibility** in object creation.

## 🏗️ When to Use  

- When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it must create.  
- To delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to subclasses.  
- To eliminate the need to bind application-specific classes into code.  
- When you want to adhere to the **Open/Closed Principle** (open for extension, closed for modification).
