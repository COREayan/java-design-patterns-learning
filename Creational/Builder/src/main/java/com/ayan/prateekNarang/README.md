**Builder Design Pattern**
- When an object requires many parameters, especially optional ones, the constructor can become hard to use or maintain. This issue can lead to:
  1. Long constructor parameter lists.
  2. Difficulty in understanding which values are optional or required.
  3. Lack of flexibility when it comes to setting only some values.
- For example, constructing an object with multiple optional parameters without the Builder pattern can look like this:

**Builder Design Pattern**
- **Problem:** When a class constructor has too many parameters, the **Builder Pattern** allows step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- **Solution:** Separates the construction of an object from its representation, offering a fluent interface for creating complex objects.
