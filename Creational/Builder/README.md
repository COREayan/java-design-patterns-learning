# 🧱 Builder Design Pattern in Java

---

## 📚 What is the Builder Pattern?

The **Builder Pattern** is used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations.

## 🏗️ When to Use

- When an object needs to be created with many optional parameters or configurations.
- When object construction should be independent of its parts and their assembly.
- To reduce the complexity of constructors with many parameters (also known as the *telescoping constructor anti-pattern*).
