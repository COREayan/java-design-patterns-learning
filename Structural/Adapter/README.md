#🔌 Adapter Design Pattern in Java

---

## 📚 What is the Adapter Pattern?

The **Adapter Pattern** acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It allows objects with mismatched interfaces to work together without modifying their source code, by wrapping one interface with another that the client expects.

## 🏗️ When to Use

- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match what your application requires.
- To reuse legacy or third-party code without modifying it.
- When you want to provide a uniform interface over multiple classes with different APIs.
- To ensure compatibility between new code and old libraries.
