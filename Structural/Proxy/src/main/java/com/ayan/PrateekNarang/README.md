**Proxy Pattern**
- **Problem:** Sometimes, direct access to an object might not be desirable due to reasons such as security, resource optimization, or controlled access. 
- **Solution:** The Proxy Pattern provides a **surrogate** or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Proxy Pattern Motivation**
- Imagine a system where we want to load a heavy object like a large image from disk. It might take time to load the image, and we don't want to load it unitl it's necessary. Without using a proxy, the application would load the image every time it's needed, even if not displayed, wasting resources.

**Proxy Pattern Benefits**
1. **Lazy Initialization:** Objects are loaded only when necessary, saving memory and CPU cycles.
2. **Access Control:** You can control access to the real object(e.g., based on user permissions).
3. **Additional Behavior:** Proxies can add addititonal functionalities like logging, access control, or caching without modifying the real object. 
4. **Separation of Concerns:** The real object only deals with its core responsibilities, while the proxy handles ancillary operations like initialization or security.
