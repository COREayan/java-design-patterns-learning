# ☕ Learning Java Design Patterns

Hi! 👋 I'm learning **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** using Java. This repository is my personal learning lab where I:

- 👨‍💻 Implement each design pattern from scratch
- 📚 Understand the real-world use case for each pattern
- 🧠 Learn to write clean, reusable, and maintainable code

## 🧱 Covered Patterns

This repo will gradually include examples from all three main categories:

- **Creational** (e.g., AbstractFactory, Builder, Factory, Prototype,  Singleton)
- **Structural** (e.g., Adapter, Bridge, Composit, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)
- **Behavioral** (e.g., Chain Of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template, Visitor)

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Java source code
- ✅ Comments explaining the flow
- ✅ A mini real-world analogy (when possible)

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this project, I want to:
- Deeply understand design patterns
- Be interview-ready for Java developer roles
- Write better architecture in real-world projects

## 📚 More Resources

To supplement my learning, I’m referring to these excellent resources:
